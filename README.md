# Node-NXT

Node-NXT is a Node.js project that can be used to control a Lego Mindstorms NXT device that is running pbLua.

Node-NXT mirrors the NXT API of pbLua, enabling you to write scripts to control the device in JavaScript.

## How to Install

    npm install node-nxt

## How to use

First, require `node-nxt`:

```js
var nodeNxt = require('node-nxt');
```

Next, connect to the device using USB port or Bluetooth (USB in this example):

```js
nodeNxt.connect ('/dev/cu.usbmodem621', function (nxt) {
	// ...
};
```

Then use the value passed to the callback in much the same way as you would in pbLua:

```js
	nxt.DisplayText ('Hello world.');
```

Use callbacks to retrieve returned values:

```js
	nxt.TimerRead (function (time) {
		sys.print ('Time on nxt: ' + time);
	});
```
